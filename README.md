# Space X Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Redux.


> The Space-X Project is a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application will allow users to book rockets and join selected space missions.

## Brief Demo

> ![screenshot](./ScreenShots/spacetravelers-hub.gif)

This **Single Page App**  was built with **React-Redux**. The main page `(Rocket Page)` has links to:
- Rocket Page
- Missions Page
- Profile Page 

The contents displayed on the Rocket's page are fetched from a [Rocket API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets). When a user clicks the _"Reserve rocket"_ button, actions are dispatched to update the store and the reserved rocket shows a _"Reserved"_ badge and "Cancel reservation" button instead of the default "Reserve rocket"


The contents displayed on the Missions' page are fetched from a [Missions API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/missions). When a user clicks the _"Join Mission"_ button, actions are dispatched to update the store, the join mission button changes to _"Leave Mission"_ and the corresponding badge for that mission shows _"Active Member"_. On the other hand, when the _"Leave Mission"_ button is clicked, the button changes to _"Join Mission"_ and the corresponding badge shows _"Not A Member"_

The Profile Page displays the Name of All `Reserved Rockets` and the `Joined Missions`.
